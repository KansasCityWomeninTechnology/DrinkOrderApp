# Programming Fundamentals

## Overview

Tonight we discussed some common programming concepts found in the JavaScript programming language.  Many of these concepts are shared across programming languages but in a different programming language the syntax (the format for how you write or utilize a specific concept) may differ slightly. You will utilize these concepts often as you write code so plenty of practice with them will help a lot!
